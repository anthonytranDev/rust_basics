# Syntax

## The exclaimation mark "!"
For now, you just need to know that using a ! means that youâ€™re calling a macro instead of a normal function.

## The ampersand "&"
'&' indicates that this argument is a reference, which gives you a way to let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to copy that data into memory multiple times.
